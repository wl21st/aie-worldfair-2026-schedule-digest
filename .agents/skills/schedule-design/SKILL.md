# Schedule Design Patterns

Lessons extracted from building the `/europe/schedule` page — a single-file (~2000 line) React component with a 2D room×time grid, 1D session list, modal detail view, multi-axis filtering, favorites, theming, and semantic search.

## Architecture

### Single-file component is fine for schedule pages
The entire page lives in one `.tsx` file. Sub-components (`TypeBadge`, `SpeakerPhoto`, `SessionModal`, `GridOverview`, `SessionCard`, `FilterPill`, `StarButton`) are defined in the same file. This avoids prop-drilling across module boundaries and keeps the schedule self-contained. Extract to separate files only when reuse is needed elsewhere.

### Build-time data extraction with `getStaticProps`
Raw JSON (with nullable/optional fields) is normalized at build time into clean `ScheduleSession` objects with guaranteed string fields (empty string, not null). This eliminates null checks throughout the render logic.

### Synthetic plenary sessions
Plenary/logistics sessions (breakfast, lunch, expo hours) are hardcoded as a `PLENARY_SESSIONS` array and merged with speaker sessions at build time. They get `id: 10000 + i` to avoid collisions.

## Theme System

### Semantic token objects, not CSS variables
Define a `Theme` type with ~40 semantic tokens (`bg`, `bgCard`, `text`, `textSecondary`, `border`, `accent`, `gridHeaderBg`, `starActive`, etc.). Create `DARK_THEME` and `LIGHT_THEME` constants. Pass `t: Theme` and `isDark: boolean` to every sub-component.

### Theme persistence across pages
Store preference in `localStorage` under a shared key (`eu-theme`). On mount, check `localStorage` first, then fall back to `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: light)')`. This syncs theme between `/europe` and `/europe/schedule`.

### Global styles must also be themed
Body background, scrollbar colors (`::webkit-scrollbar-*`), text selection (`::selection`), and any `<style jsx global>` blocks must reference theme tokens. Don't forget the logo image — use `filter: invert(1)` for light mode if the logo is white-on-transparent.

## 2D Grid Overview (Room × Time)

### HTML `<table>` for the grid, not CSS grid
A real `<table>` with `<thead>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, `<td>` handles column alignment, sticky headers, and horizontal scroll correctly. CSS Grid struggles with sticky columns in a scrollable container.

### Sticky header and sticky first column(s)
- Day header row: `position: sticky; top: 0; zIndex: 20` with `colSpan={rooms.length + 1}` so it spans full width on horizontal scroll.
- Room header row: `position: sticky; top: 30px` (offset by day header height).
- Time column: `position: sticky; left: 0; zIndex: 10`.
- Priority column (e.g. Plenary): `position: sticky; left: 48px` (offset by time column width), `zIndex: 10`.

### Plenary column spanning
Plenary sessions span across the full day, so the Plenary column needs special logic: track which plenary sessions are "active" (started before, ending after) each time slot, and render continuing sessions with reduced opacity and a "continues" label.

### Room sort order matters
Sort rooms: Plenary first → Keynote rooms → Regular rooms (alphabetical) → Special rooms (e.g. Leadership Lunch) → Expo rooms. Use a numeric group assignment for sorting.

### Bright pastel grid cell colors with dark text
Grid cells use a separate `GRID_COLORS` palette with bright pastel backgrounds and dark text — different from the badge colors which use dark backgrounds with light text. This improves readability in the dense grid.

### Cell overflow
Set `maxHeight: 80` and `overflowY: 'auto'` on grid cell content divs so dense cells scroll rather than expanding the row.

### Grid cell click → modal
Clicking a grid cell opens a `SessionModal` overlay (not inline expansion). The modal uses `position: fixed; inset: 0` with backdrop blur, and closes on ESC, backdrop click, or close button. Lock body scroll (`document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden'`) while modal is open.

## Filter System

### Type grouping for cleaner filters
Map granular types into user-friendly groups. Example: `track_keynote`, `talk`, and `lightning` all map to a single `"talks"` filter group via a `TYPE_FILTER_GROUPS` record and `typeFilterGroup()` function. Individual session badges still show the specific type — only the filter pills are grouped.

### Inclusive multi-select with `Set<string>`
Each filter axis (day, type, track) uses a `Set<string>`. Empty set = no filter (show all). Use a `toggleSet` helper to add/remove values immutably.

### Filter panel is collapsible, but active state must be obvious
When the filter panel is collapsed:
1. The "Filters" button turns purple/highlighted with badge count: `Filters (3) ▼`.
2. A compact summary strip below the header shows active filter chips.
3. The session count in the header (`92/214`) turns bold + accent color.

Without these, users don't realize filters are active — this was a real usability issue.

### Filter layout: grouped rows with labels
Each filter axis gets its own row with an uppercase label (`DAY`, `TYPE`, `TRACK`). A separate row at the bottom holds "Starred", "Clear all filters", and a count summary. This is much clearer than a single inline row of mixed pills.

### Starred/favorites in localStorage
Use `localStorage` key `aie-schedule-favorites` storing a JSON array of session IDs. Wrap in a `useFavorites` hook returning `{ favorites, toggleFavorite, isFavorited }`. Starred items get a golden border/glow in the grid: `boxShadow: '0 0 8px rgba(250,204,21,0.5)'`.

## Session Display

### Title first, then speaker attribution
Grid cells and cards show the session title first, then speaker info below. Speaker attribution format: `{name} - {company}, {role}` with graceful fallbacks — omit dash/comma segments if company or role is missing.

### TBD speaker detection
Use regex `/^tbd\b/i` to detect placeholder speaker names and render them with reduced opacity.

### Speaker photos with initials fallback
`SpeakerPhoto` component tries to load the image, falls back to a circular badge with initials (extracted from name) on error. Use `loading="lazy"` on images.

## URL State

### Modal state syncs to URL query param
Opening a modal sets `?session=<id>` via shallow router replace. On mount, check `router.query.session` to restore the modal. This makes session links shareable.

## Semantic Search

### Debounced API call with request-ID guard
Each keystroke increments a `semanticRequestIdRef`. Only the response whose ID matches the latest ref is applied — stale/out-of-order responses are silently dropped. Use `AbortController` for cleanup. Debounce delay: 400ms.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **`next lint` doesn't work in Next.js 16** — use `npx tsc --noEmit` instead.
2. **Sticky `position` in tables**: `position: sticky` on `<td>` requires explicit `background` — otherwise transparent cells show content underneath during scroll.
3. **`colSpan` on day headers**: Without proper `colSpan` spanning all columns, the day header won't stretch when scrolling horizontally.
4. **Plenary contrast**: Dark-on-dark or light-on-light plenary badges are easy to miss. Give plenary sessions distinct, high-contrast colors in both palettes.
5. **Line height in dense grid cells**: Default line height is too spacious for 9-10px text in grid cells. Use `lineHeight: 1.15`.
6. **Room name typos**: Always validate room names against the source data (e.g. "Westley" vs "Wesley"). A bulk rename in the JSON source is safer than patching in rendering code.
7. **Filter state invisible to users**: The most common UX complaint was "I don't know why I'm seeing fewer sessions." Always make active filter state visible even when the filter panel is collapsed.
